# DH140-Final-Project

This repository holds a project that uses data from the paper "Diversity of Artists in Major U.S. Museums" by Topaz, Klingenberg, Turek, Heggeseth, Harris, Blackwood, Chavoya, Nelson and Murphy to explore the representation of artists in U.S. museums and analyze how history directly impacts diversity in the art world today. I'm interested in the social and political factors that may influence the lack of diversity of artists reported in this dataset. Gender, ethnicity, geographic origin, and year all play an important role in the social power structure that caters to white men. I was interested in the diversity of artists in major U.S. museums because as a person of color, it is very common to be underrepresented feel neglected. By learning more about artist diversity from the years 1500-2000, I hope to become more open-minded and appreciate efforts made to increase diversity and celebrate our differences.

The project provides information supporting the research, exploratory data analysis, and various visualizations to help the reader identify patterns or trends that affect the art world and which artists are featured in U.S. museums.
